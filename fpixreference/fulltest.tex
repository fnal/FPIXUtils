\subsection{\fulltest}
\label{ss:fulltest}

The suite of tests that is run to qualify forward pixel modules is called the
\fulltest. It is a sequential test suite composed of the following tests
that are described in more detail in the previous sections.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \pretest: configures the basic \dacs to ensure that the \roc is in a functioning state.
  \item \alivetest: checks that all pixels respond to an input signal and have the correct addresses associated with them.
  \item \trimming: sets all pixels to turn on with the same input signal strength
  \item \phopt: optimizes the dynamic range of the output pulse heights as calculated by the ADC serializer
  \item \gainped: measures and stores the gain of each pixel and checks the linearity of the ADC response
  \item \scurves: validates the trimming and measures pixel noise
  \item \bb: flags potential issues in bump bond quality
\end{itemize}
In addition to the \fulltest, each module undergoes an \iv test that measures leakage current as a function of the reverse bias voltage.
For technical reasons described in Section~\ref{s:testing}, this test is performed separately from the \fulltest.
