The pixel module for the CMS Phase I upgrade consists of several discrete components, manufactured by independent contractors.  
The silicon sensor is the active unit of the module, converting energy deposited by incident particles into an electrical signal.  
Each sensor contains 66,560 individual pixels.  
The standard pixel size is 100 $\mu$m $\times$ 150 $\mu$m, although some edge pixels are twice as large in the dimension perpendicular to the sensor edge.  

The psi46 readout chip (ROC) is an ~8 mm square integrated circuit that takes the signal from the sensor, 
processes it, and packages the data to be sent onward in the readout chain.  
Each ROC covers an array of 80 $\times$ 52 pixels (4160 pixels).  

The high density interconnect (HDI) is a printed flexible circuit that accepts the data from multiple ROCs 
and combines it to be transmitted to the central CMS data acquisition (DAQ) system.  
The serialization of the data is performed by the token bit manager (TBM) which is a logic chip glued onto the HDI.
