Once a module has been tested, the resulting information is uploaded onto two remote servers:
One for visualization and one for documentation.
The shifters will execute provided scripts that format the test results appropriately 
and upload them to both of these servers.
The visualization is achieved via the {\tt MoReWeb} software package which processes the test results
and creates a set of html pages to help navigate through the results of a given module.
This server can be accessed here:

The documenting of test results and grading of modules is done by the Purdue FPix database, found here: 
\begin{center}
http://www.physics.purdue.edu/cmsfpix/Submission\_p/index.php
\end{center}
This database tracks module components from their origins through their inclusion in FPix modules.
It also stores all the configuration files and output root files generated during module testing.  
It has the functionality to search through the entire set of constructed modules, filtering on grade, location, etc.
