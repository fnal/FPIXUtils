\subsection{\scurves Test}
\label{ss:scurves}

\subsubsection{Purpose}

The \scurves test has two primary purposes.
First, it evaluates the efficacy of the \trimming test.
Secondly, it measures the noise present in each pixel and can potentially flag abnormally noisy pixels.
Both of these goals are achieved by fitting the curve of efficiency vs. \vcal for each pixel.
The test gets its name from the shape of the error function used to fit the measured curve.
